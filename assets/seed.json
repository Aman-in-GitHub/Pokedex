      "TENTACRUEL has large red orbs on its head. The orbs glow before lashing the vicinity with a harsh ultrasonic blast. This POKéMON’s outburst creates rough waves around it.",
      "TENTACRUEL has tentacles that can be freely elongated and shortened at will. It ensnares prey with its tentacles and weakens the prey by dosing it with a harsh toxin. It can catch up to 80 prey at the same time.",
      "It lives in complex rock formations on the ocean floor and traps prey using its 80 tentacles. Its red orbs glow when it grows excited or agitated.",
      "It has 80 tentacles that move about freely. They can sting, causing poisoning and sharp, stabbing pain.",
      "With 80 tentacles for ensnaring victims, it prevents escape until the prey is weakened by poison.",

      "Although these Pokémon are rare, when a large outbreak of them occurs, all fish Pokémon disappear from the surrounding sea.",
      "It fires off ultrasonic waves from its red orbs to weaken its prey, and then it wraps them up in its 80 tentacles.",
      "It communicates with others of its kind by lighting up the red orbs on its head. When the orbs are blinking, it’s a warning sign.",
      "When the red orbs on Tentacruel’s head glow brightly, watch out. The Pokémon is about to fire off a burst of ultrasonic waves.",
      "Its 80 tentacles can stretch and shrink freely. Tentacruel ensnares prey in a net of spread-out tentacles, delivering venomous stings to its catch.",
      "It has 80 tentacles, each with a venomous tip. These tentacles are also extendible, lengthening when Tentacruel attempts to catch prey. Use caution."
